Self learn Git and Github :)

To change this file directly on Github, click on the Pencil icon, and type, and save

update: I have successfully connected git with vsc and cloned this repo into my local computer using https (try to avoid ssh, this is better now)

update: I have added in this line and pushed onto the master branch (file), this is a revision

update: this line is done using a pull request (PR), it helps authors of the repo to read the commits from branches before merging it with main (avoid mistakes), other programmers can also review and comment on the changes before the authors can approve the PR
PR will be including the total commits (before the last merge) and send it for the author of the repo to view and decide to merge to master

update: undoing helps remove mistakes that were either already staged/committed
staged -> git restore -S *
//can also use "--staged"
committed -> git reset HEAD~1
//HEAD is a pointer, now points to the last (before) commit
